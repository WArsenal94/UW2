    <h1>My Life Story</h1>
  <section>
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Washington State University two years ago, and I currently work as an systems design engineer in the Seattle area.</p>
     <p>I enrolled myself in this certificate with hope of switching to software engineering.</p>

  <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
  <p>I am planning to switch my career first and then I am planning to move to Seattle after this pandamic is over</p>
 <p>I also plan to gain back the weight I lost becasue of the lockdown. I am scared to go to the gym again and that is the main reason I lost weight.</p>
